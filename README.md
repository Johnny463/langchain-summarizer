# PDF to Summarized PDF Converter

This Python program allows you to convert a regular PDF document into a summarized PDF using language processing techniques. It leverages the [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/use_cases/summarization) library and [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2) for text extraction and manipulation. With this tool, you can condense lengthy PDFs into shorter, more digestible versions.


## Prerequisites

Before you can use this program,you have the appropriate Python version specified in the `runtime.txt` file. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can find them listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make sure to add environment of 'OPEN_API_KEY' with your actual OpenAI API key.OR you can this in code:
```bash
import os
os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
```
This approach allows you to securely store and use your API key without hardcoding it directly into your code. It's a best practice for managing sensitive information like API keys.

and don't forget to replace placeholders like `"your_pdf.pdf"` with actual file paths or relevant information.




## Usage
Place the PDF file you want to summarize in the same directory as app.py.

Modify the app.py file if necessary to customize the summarization process according to your preferences.

Run the app.py script:

```bash
python app.py
```
The program will extract text from the PDF, generate a summary, and create a new summarized PDF in the same directory.

## Customization
You can customize the summarization process by modifying the app.py file. Some possible customizations include:

Adjusting the length of the summary-
Chunk size-
Per page readabliity-Font style
